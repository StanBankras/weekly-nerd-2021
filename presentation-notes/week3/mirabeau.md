* Stages in design at Mirabeau:
  * Concepting
  * Design production
  * Design review
  * Browser handoff
  * Development review
  * Documentation
* CMD frontenders can bridge the gap between development and design easier
* Designing in the browser is possible if you have components
* MVP: not as many features but as many value as possible
* Always build progressively enhanced
  * Sometimes time pressure can lead to not making it fully enhanced
* SSR with React: Next.js
  * Solve problem of no SEO
  * Quicker initial load
  * No JS users still see content
* Use SPA online when project requires it
* Research how to support every layer of the web
